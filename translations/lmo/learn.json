  "faq_title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq_instance_q": "Q: What is an \"instance\"? How do I pick one?",
  "faq_instance_a": "<p><strong>A:</strong> Each fediverse network is made up of <mark>\"instances\"</mark>, or <mark>\"servers\"</mark>. For example, if you want to join <a href='https://joinmastodon.org/'>Mastodon</a>, you can sign up for an account on <a href='https://mastodon.social'>mastodon.social</a> or <a href='https://mas.to'>mas.to</a>, or <a href='https://joinmastodon.org/servers'>any other Mastodon server</a>.</p><p>You can even <a href='https://stefanbohacek.com/blog/lessons-learned-from-running-a-single-person-mastodon-instance/#hosting'>run your own server</a>.</p><p>Moving between different instances is easy, and you'll be able to <mark>carry your friends and followers with you</mark>, so don't worry about picking the right instance from the start. Just sign up, feel things out, and you can move to another instance, or another network altogether, if you find a better fit.</p>",
  "faq_decentralized_social_media_q": "Q: What is \"decentralized social media\"? Why is it good?",
  "faq_decentralized_social_media_a": "<p><strong>A:</strong> Remember when <a href='https://botwiki.org/blog/elon-musk-steps-in-as-the-new-owner-of-twitter/'>Elon Musk bought Twitter</a> and started changing things that drew a lot of people away? This is a lot less likely to happen with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network'>social media sites that run across many servers</a>, because you'd have to buy all of them to control the whole network. And people can keep creating new ones.</p>",
  "faq_funding_q": "Q: Is the fediverse free to join? Who pays for these servers?",
  "faq_funding_a": "<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, joining any of the servers is typically free. Communities are maintained and moderated by <mark>volunteers</mark>, often paying for hosting from their own pocket. If you can afford it, and there is an option to do so, consider supporting them with a <mark>donation</mark>.</p>",
  "faq_rules_q": "Q: What rules do I have to follow?",
  "faq_rules_a": "<p><strong>A:</strong> That depends on the <mark>community</mark>. Each server can set their own rules, but generally it's important to treat other members of the community with <mark>kindness and respect</mark>. A few things to remember:</p>",
  "faq_rules_general": "<li><mark>caption your images</mark>, so that those who can't see them still get to enjoy them</li><li>use <mark>hashtags</mark> generously, this is how others can find your posts</li><li>if your server has this features, use <mark>content warnings</mark> as appropriate</li><li>if you see something wrong, <mark>report it to the admins</mark></li>",
